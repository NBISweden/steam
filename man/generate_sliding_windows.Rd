\title{Generate Sliding Windows from a Ranked Gene List}
\usage{
generate_sliding_windows(
  char_vector,
  window_size,
  step_size,
  disease_abbr,
  ot_gene_set_label
)
}
\arguments{
\item{char_vector}{A character vector of ranked gene symbols.}

\item{window_size}{Integer. The number of genes in each window.}

\item{step_size}{Integer. The step size between window starts (i.e., the number of genes to slide).}

\item{disease_abbr}{Character. A short abbreviation for the disease/trait (e.g., \code{"ALZ"}).}

\item{ot_gene_set_label}{Character. A label for the gene set type (e.g., \code{"Genetic"}).}
}
\value{
A named list of character vectors, where each vector represents a gene window.
Names follow the format \code{"ALZ_Genetic_Rank1"}, \code{"ALZ_Genetic_Rank2"}, etc.
}
\description{
Creates overlapping gene windows from a ranked character vector. This is commonly
used to segment ranked gene lists (e.g., by association score) into fixed-size windows
for downstream enrichment analysis. Only full windows of the specified size are returned.
}
\examples{
ranked_genes <- c("Gene1", "Gene2", "Gene3", "Gene4", "Gene5", "Gene6")
generate_sliding_windows(ranked_genes, window_size = 3, step_size = 2, disease_abbr = "ALZ", ot_gene_set_label = "Genetic")
}
