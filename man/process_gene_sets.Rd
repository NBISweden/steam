\title{Process Gene Sets and Create Overlapping Windows}
\usage{
process_gene_sets(
  all_gene_sets,
  windows_list,
  condition_name,
  gene_set_index,
  win_size = 50,
  move_size = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{all_gene_sets}{A list of gene sets for various conditions.}

\item{windows_list}{A list of overlapping windows generated from `split_with_overlap`.}

\item{condition_name}{The name of the condition to process.}

\item{gene_set_index}{The index of the gene set to process within `all_gene_sets`.}

\item{win_size}{The size of the sliding window (default: 50).}

\item{move_size}{The step size of the sliding window (default: 10).}
}
\value{
A named list with processed genetic and drug-related windows.
}
\description{
This function processes gene sets for a specific condition by creating overlapping windows
and assigning them descriptive names.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
result <- process_gene_sets(all_gene_sets, windows_list, "Brain", 1)
}
}
